# About
WTV-MetaRenamer is a PowerShell script that takes a directory containing WTV files of TV recordingers created by Windows Media Centre and renames them based on series, season and episode information gathered from the metadata in the file and TheTVDB web site.

Primary documentation is in the form of a PDF file in the repository. I'll try and convert this to wiki pages if I can find the time.

# Windows Media Centre?
Yes, well, it was a very popular platform in its day. Today, not so much, particularly given that it is no longer a part of Windows.

That said, the script has been used by a lot of people and has been stable for a long time now. Development has largely ceased, primarily since I don't have Media Centre myself any longer so testing changes to the script is challenging :).

# The Future
If you want to fork this code or make contributions through Pull Requests, please feel free. There is a lot of strong logic in the script that could be re-used with other recording platforms which is why the code is being kept on GitHub.
